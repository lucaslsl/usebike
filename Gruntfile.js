/**
 * Gruntfile
 *
 * This Node script is executed when you run `grunt` or `sails lift`.
 * It's purpose is to load the Grunt tasks in your project's `tasks`
 * folder, and allow you to add and remove tasks as you see fit.
 * For more information on how this works, check out the `README.md`
 * file that was generated in your `tasks` folder.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * Unless you know what you're doing, you shouldn't change this file.
 * Check out the `tasks` directory instead.
 *
 * For more information see:
 *   http://sailsjs.com/anatomy/Gruntfile.js
